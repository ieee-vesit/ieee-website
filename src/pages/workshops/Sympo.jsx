        description="Melange is IEEE VESIT’s formal farewell event that honors the incredible journey and contribution of the outgoing council members. It’s a time of gratitude, reflection, and celebration as the council signs off after three years of dedication, hard work, and impact.

        The event also marks key launches — the annual IEEE VESIT Magazine featuring technical articles, creative work, and highlights from the year, along with the unveiling of the newly developed IEEE VESIT Website and Mobile App, a testament to the council's vision of enhancing digital engagement.

        Melange beautifully captures the spirit of transition, growth, and fresh beginnings — celebrating not just an end, but a new chapter for the IEEE community."
