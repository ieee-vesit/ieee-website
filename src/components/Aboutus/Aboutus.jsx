          The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a
          professional association for electronic engineering and electrical
          engineering (and associated disciplines) with its corporate office in
          New York City and its operations center in Piscataway, New Jersey. The
          mission of the IEEE is advancing technology for the benefit of
          humanity. The IEEE was formed from the amalgamation of the American
